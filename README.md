# Threat Hunting Project

## Overview
This repository documents a **multi-VM threat hunting lab** designed to simulate an enterprise environment. Simulating a cybersecurity analyst, the goal of this project is to identify weaknesses, track Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), and strengthen defenses across a simulated internal network.  

## Project Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with threat hunting techniques.  
- Identify and analyze IoCs across multiple scenarios.  
- Understand and investigate abnormal network activity.  
- Develop practical skills in detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities.

## Table of Contents
- [Threat Hunting: Network Events](Threat-Hunting-Network-Events.pdf)
- [Threat Hunting: New IoC](Threat-Hunting-New-IoC.pdf)
- [Analyzing Logs and System Information](Analyzing-Logs-and-System-Info.pdf)
- [Investigating DNS Activity](Investigating-DNS-Activity.pdf)  

## Lab Activities
1. **Firewall Logging** – Analyze logs to detect questionable network traffic.  
2. **Netstat Analysis** – Use `netstat` to uncover IoCs tied to traffic abuse against a secure website.  
3. **Targeted Threat Hunting** – Conduct scenario-based hunts to trace and analyze suspicious behavior.  
4. **DNS Investigation** – Investigate unusual DNS activity to identify additional IoCs.  

## Lab Environment
This project uses a **multi-VM setup** to replicate an enterprise-style infrastructure:  
- **LAMP**: Ubuntu server hosting a web application  
- **KALI**: Debian-based penetration testing system  
- **DC10**: Windows Server 2019 domain controller hosting a secure website  
- **MS10**: Windows Server 2016  
- **PC10**: Windows Server 2019 client  

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Threat hunting and IoC analysis  
- Firewall and network log analysis  
- Identifying suspicious traffic patterns  
- Investigating DNS-based anomalies  
- Working in enterprise-style multi-VM environments
